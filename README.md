# Visibility

This repository contains scripts for intervisibility calculation and prominence assessment in ground truthed burial mounds in the Yambol province. Figures produced through these scripts are published in DigiThrace special issue. 
The scripts need a bit more clean up:

- split chronology it its own section/script
- separate the compute-intense calculations into separate scripts
- move all figures into 1-2 scripts (currently in 1 : chrono, rasterprofile, 3: veg models, and 4: maps)
- check all the interim products are consistently named
